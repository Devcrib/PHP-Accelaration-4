# PHP-Accelaration-4
Today, we will be dealing with a large data file using PHP 7 as an approach

## Description
We created a simple website that contain two or three web pages, with one of the pages has a section that shows some of the team generated from the data given.

Another page displayed all the data as a team using card form, then another page displays the profile of each selected user all from the data.

It is an awesome day!!!
